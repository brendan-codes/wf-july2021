bugs might take a while to find, but they rarely take a long time to fix.

don’t panic the only risk of here is you find and expose your weaknesses and where you need additional study.
this is not a placement exam, you are doing it to learn.

don’t watch the clock try to set alarms for a midway point, a last hour, a last 15 minutes.
clock watching kills braincells.

if you finish 100% of everything you know, how close are you to finishing?
